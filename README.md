# Go Language #

Here is some tools programmed using Go Language.

I'm not used so much Go, but when I like to make some nice ex. commandtool to *nix and Windows, then my selection is Go.
Nice cross compiling, one binary file to install. No library hasling in the destination. 

I am in the process of learning Go and therefore
I am sure there are much better, more Go-idiomatic ways to achieve this functionality. If you have feedback on how to improve
the code or want to contribute, please do not hesitate to do so. I'd really like to improve my GO skills and learn things.

Go is more hoppy and nice tool to make compact program to install *nix+Windows.

In real life I need lot of convert CSV output to the Excel and
read input data from Excel. CSV/Json/XML formats are my working formats, because ex. Postgresql like to use COPY command to import/export.
Also awk-command,ksh,... like to use CSV files.
